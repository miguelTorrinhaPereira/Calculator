A good calculator

Features:

- Has a history of all calculations made, and it's easy to go back.
- Can expand to give access to a ton of mathematical functions, log, pi, e, root, exponent, sin, asin, abs, ceil, factorial, mod, and others.
- You can move the cursor to edit the calculation.
- The window adapts to resizing.
- You can use the keyboard to type directly and has shortcuts for every feature.
- Has two modes, normal and scientific, where it respects significant digits in multiplication and division and respects the decimal places in addition and subtraction. This mode also supports every function.

Keyboard shortcuts:

- Ctrl + Backspace: clears everything.
- Return (Enter): does the calculation.
- Up Arrow: goes to the previous calculation.
- Down Arrow: goes to next calculation.
- Tab: expands the menu.
- Ctrl + Tab: toggles between 1st and 2nd.
- Escape (Esc): shows the mode selection menu.

It only works in Linux because it appears that the buttons for some reason are bigger for the same size in Linux than in Windows. I have no idea why this happens.
